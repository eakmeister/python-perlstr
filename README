This is a project to bring perl-style string substitution to Python. Why?
Because I wanted to see if I could. Example:

    import perlstr
    test = 42
    print '\\$test = $test'()
    # prints '$test = 42'

In order to have python run the substitution, simply call the string. Simple,
right? Again you ask why, and again the answer is "because". I wanted to make
Python do it automatically on all string literals, but I couldn't find a way to
do that from within Python. If you find a way, let me know.
